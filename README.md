# ðŸšœ Predicting Sales Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning
In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sales price of bulldozer.

1. Problem Definition
Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.

2. Data
Data is download from Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozer competition.

There are 3 main datasets:
* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012
* Test.csv is the test set

3. Evaluation
The evaluation metric is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

4. Features
Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all the features of the dataset. View this data on Google Sheet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-jyQNxlD2HyhArkHa0dTAw7TG3HrXyDfL-V_bkfn5mU/edit?usp=sharing
